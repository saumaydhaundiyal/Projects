# CodeX Insights

This is a part of a codebasics Data Analytics challenge in which I won 3rd prize. 

CodeX is a German beverage company that is aiming to make its mark in the Indian market. A few months ago, they launched their energy drink in 10 cities in India.

Their Marketing team is responsible for increasing brand awareness, market share, and product development. They surveyed in those 10 cities and received results from 10k respondents. 

A marketing data analyst is tasked to convert these survey results to meaningful insights which the team can use to drive actions.

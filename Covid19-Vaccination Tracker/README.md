# Covid-19 Vaccination Tracker

This project was done to understand how dashboarding skills can help the stakeholders to get the data they need at a glance. 

Just the look at the dashboard and they can quickly access all the information they need. 

Here I tried to create a Global Vaccination Tracker to understand how the vaccination drive in different countries are going. 

Note: In my mind here, I was making this for WHO to help them with quick access to this data.

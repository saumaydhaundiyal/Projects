The files contains four of the projects that I have done so far. 
        1. CodeX Insights: This was the project I did as a part of a Data Analytics 
           challenge which is hosted by codebasics. I received 3rd Prize in this competition.
        2. Covid19 Vaccination Tracker: In this project, I aim to work on my dashboarding skills 
           and tried to create a dashboard using Tableau which would allow the user to track the 
           vaccination prgress of countries around the world. 
        3. Electronic Store Sales Insights: This project includes Data exploration, Data cleaning
           and Data visualiztion. In this project I explored to Python itself as a visualization tool. 
        4. London Bike Sharing: This is a Data Exploration and a Data Cleaning Project to assist the 
           visualization experts by providing them with a clean data set. 

I have explained more in detail about the individual projects in their own personal readme files.
I have learned a decent amount of SQL and would like to add SQL projects soon in the repository.
